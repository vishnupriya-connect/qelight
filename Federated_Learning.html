      <h2 class="section-title">About This Course</h2>
      <p>
        This two-part course covers the fundamentals and advanced applications of federated learning using the Flower framework. Federated learning
        enables training across distributed data sources, enhancing data privacy and security. In part one, you’ll set up and tune federated learning
        systems, and in part two, you’ll apply these methods to large language models (LLMs).
