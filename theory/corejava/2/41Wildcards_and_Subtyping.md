# Wildcards and Subtyping in Java

1. **Understanding Wildcards**: Wildcards in Java generics allow for flexibility in type usage when working with collections and methods. They are denoted by the `?` symbol and can represent any type. This is particularly useful when the specific type is not essential for the operation being performed:
   ```java
   public void processList(List<?> list) {
       // Can accept List<String>, List<Integer>, etc.
   }
   ```

2. **Covariant and Contravariant Wildcards**: Java supports two types of wildcards that relate to subtyping. Covariant wildcards (using `<? extends T>`) allow for reading from a structure while ensuring that the objects are of type T or its subtypes. Contravariant wildcards (using `<? super T>`) allow for writing to a structure and ensure that the structure can hold T or its supertypes:
   ```java
   public void addNumbers(List<? super Integer> list) {
       list.add(10); // Adding Integer or its subtypes is safe
   }

   public void readNumbers(List<? extends Number> numbers) {
       for (Number num : numbers) {
           System.out.println(num); // Reading is safe
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Type Inference with Wildcards**: When using wildcards in method parameters, Java can infer the specific types from the context. This allows for more concise code without requiring explicit type arguments, improving readability:
   ```java
   public void printElements(List<?> elements) {
       for (Object element : elements) {
           System.out.println(element);
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Limits of Wildcards**: While wildcards provide flexibility, they come with limitations. For instance, you cannot add elements to a list with an unbounded wildcard (i.e., `List<?>`), nor can you read elements as a specific type from a list defined with wildcards. This is due to the lack of type information available at runtime:
   ```java
   List<?> list = new ArrayList<String>();
   // list.add("Hello"); // Compile-time error: cannot add to the list
   ```

5. **Wildcards in Subtyping Relationships**: Wildcards interact with Java's subtyping rules. For example, a `List<Dog>` is not a subtype of `List<Animal>`, but a `List<? extends Animal>` can accept a `List<Dog>`, allowing for polymorphic behavior in method calls:
   ```java
   public void processAnimals(List<? extends Animal> animals) {
       // Accepts List<Dog>, List<Cat>, etc.
   }
   ```
