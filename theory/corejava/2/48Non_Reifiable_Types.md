# Non-Reifiable Types in Java

1. **Definition**: Non-reifiable types are types in Java whose information is not fully available at runtime due to type erasure. These types cannot be instantiated or used in certain operations because the generic type information has been removed during compilation:
   ```java
   public class Box<T> {
       private T item;
   }
   // After erasure, Box<T> is treated as Box<Object> at runtime, making T non-reifiable
   ```

2. **Examples of Non-Reifiable Types**: The primary example of non-reifiable types includes generic types like `List<T>`, where T can be any object type. Additionally, wildcard types such as `List<?>` and bounded type parameters like `List<? extends Number>` are also considered non-reifiable:
   ```java
   List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>(); // List<String> is non-reifiable
   ```

3. **Limitations**: Due to their non-reifiable nature, you cannot create instances of generic types, perform `instanceof` checks with generic types, or create arrays of generic types. This limitation arises because the actual type information is lost after type erasure:
   ```java
   // Cannot do: T obj = new T(); // Compile-time error
   // Cannot do: if (obj instanceof T) {} // Compile-time error
   ```

4. **Impact on Collections**: When working with collections that use non-reifiable types, you can only treat them as their raw type (without generics) or as `Object`. This restricts type safety and can lead to potential `ClassCastException` at runtime if not handled carefully:
   ```java
   List<?> wildList = new ArrayList<String>();
   // Object item = wildList.get(0); // Retrieved as Object, needs casting
   ```

5. **Handling Non-Reifiable Types**: To work around the limitations of non-reifiable types, use helper methods and wildcard types that can provide more flexibility while still maintaining type safety. Proper documentation and design patterns can help mitigate issues associated with non-reifiable types:
   ```java
   public void processList(List<? extends Number> list) {
       for (Number num : list) {
           System.out.println(num); // Works safely with Number
       }
   }
   ```
