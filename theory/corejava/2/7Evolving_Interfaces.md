# Evolving Interfaces in Java

1. **Backward Compatibility**: When evolving interfaces, it's crucial to maintain backward compatibility. This ensures that existing implementations continue to work without modification when the interface is updated.

2. **Adding Default Methods**: Java 8 introduced default methods, allowing new methods to be added to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. This enables interface evolution while keeping old code functional:
   ```java
   public interface MyInterface {
       void existingMethod();
       default void newDefaultMethod() {
           // Default implementation
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Avoiding Method Removal**: Removing methods from an interface can break existing implementations. Instead, consider marking methods as deprecated to signal their eventual removal while allowing existing code to function temporarily.

4. **Using Marker Interfaces**: For evolving interfaces, consider using marker interfaces (interfaces without methods) to add metadata or characteristics. This allows you to extend functionality without modifying the interface's method signatures.

5. **Versioning Interfaces**: When significant changes are required, consider creating a new version of the interface rather than modifying the existing one. This can be achieved by using a version suffix or prefix, allowing developers to migrate to the new version at their own pace:
   ```java
   public interface MyInterfaceV2 {
       void newMethod();
   }
   ```
