# Erasure of Generic Methods in Java

1. **Definition of Generic Method Erasure**: When a generic method is compiled, the Java compiler removes all type parameters from the method signature. This process is known as type erasure, which ensures that the method can operate on any type while retaining compatibility with non-generic code:
   ```java
   public <T> void display(T item) {
       System.out.println(item);
   }
   // After erasure, the method signature becomes: public void display(Object item)
   ```

2. **Compile-Time Safety**: Type erasure enables compile-time type checks for generic methods. This means that the compiler verifies the correctness of type arguments used in method calls, ensuring type safety before the code runs:
   ```java
   display("Hello"); // Valid call
   display(10); // Valid call
   // display(new Object()); // Also valid, but requires casting inside the method
   ```

3. **Impact on Method Overloading**: When two or more generic methods have the same erasure (i.e., their signatures become indistinguishable after erasure), it can lead to compilation errors. The Java compiler cannot differentiate between the methods, which restricts method overloading:
   ```java
   public <T> void process(T item) {}
   public <U> void process(U item) {} // Both methods have the same erased signature
   ```

4. **Wildcard Handling**: Wildcards used in generic methods also undergo type erasure. For example, a method defined as `public void process(List<? extends Number> numbers)` will be treated as `public void process(List numbers)` at runtime. This can affect type safety when working with collections:
   ```java
   public void process(List<? extends Number> numbers) {
       // At runtime, numbers is treated as List
   }
   ```

5. **Limits on Instantiation**: Due to type erasure, you cannot create instances of type parameters in generic methods. For example, you cannot do something like `T obj = new T();` because the actual type of T is not known at runtime, which prevents the creation of objects of a generic type:
   ```java
   public <T> void createInstance() {
       // T obj = new T(); // Compile-time error: cannot create a new instance of T
   }
   ```
