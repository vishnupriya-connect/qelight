# Wildcard Capture and Helper Methods in Java

1. **Wildcard Capture**: Wildcard capture occurs when a wildcard type is assigned to a type parameter within a method. This allows the compiler to replace the wildcard with a specific type, making it easier to work with collections that use wildcards. It can help in writing methods that accept multiple types:
   ```java
   public <T> void addToList(List<? super T> list, T item) {
       list.add(item); // Captures the wildcard type to T
   }
   ```

2. **Helper Methods**: Helper methods are often used in conjunction with wildcard capture to simplify the handling of complex generics in Java. They allow you to break down a complicated method into smaller, manageable pieces while maintaining type safety:
   ```java
   public <T> void copy(List<? super T> dest, List<? extends T> src) {
       for (T item : src) {
           dest.add(item); // Safely adds item to the destination list
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Benefits of Wildcard Capture**: Using wildcard capture in helper methods can lead to clearer code and reduce redundancy. It allows for more flexible method signatures that can operate on different types while ensuring type safety:
   ```java
   public void copyNumbers(List<? super Number> dest, List<? extends Number> src) {
       copy(dest, src); // Calls a generic copy method
   }
   ```

4. **Type Inference with Captured Wildcards**: When a method utilizes wildcard capture, Java can infer the specific type used in the method body based on the type arguments passed during the method call. This makes the code cleaner and reduces the need for explicit type declarations:
   ```java
   List<Number> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
   List<Integer> integers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
   copyNumbers(numbers, integers); // Inferred type captures Integer as Number
   ```

5. **Restrictions on Wildcard Capture**: While wildcard capture provides benefits, it has some restrictions. For example, you cannot use wildcard capture to modify the type of an existing collection. Wildcard capture is primarily intended for use within method bodies, and its use outside can lead to compile-time errors:
   ```java
   // List<T> cannot be assigned a wildcard capture outside of its scope
   List<?> list = new ArrayList<String>(); // Valid
   // T captured cannot be referenced outside the method where it was captured
   ```
