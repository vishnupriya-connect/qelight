# Creating and Using Packages in Java

1. **Creating a Package**: To create a package, use the `package` keyword at the top of your Java source file. The package declaration must be the first line (excluding comments) in the file. For example:
   ```java
   package com.example.myapp; // Declaring a package
   ```
   Ensure that the directory structure matches the package name, e.g., `com/example/myapp`.

2. **Compiling Packages**: When compiling Java files that belong to a package, navigate to the parent directory of the package structure and use the `javac` command with the full package name. For example:
   ```bash
   javac com/example/myapp/MyClass.java
   ```
   This will create the `.class` files in the same directory structure.

3. **Using Classes from Packages**: To use classes from your own or external packages, you need to import them using the `import` statement. You can import specific classes or entire packages. For example:
   ```java
   import com.example.myapp.MyClass; // Importing a specific class
   import com.example.myapp.*; // Importing all classes from the package
   ```

4. **Access Control**: Classes and members of classes can have different access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`, and default). When using packages, `public` members are accessible from any other package, while classes with default access are only accessible within their own package:
   ```java
   public class PublicClass {} // Accessible from any package
   class DefaultClass {} // Accessible only within the same package
   ```

5. **Best Practices for Package Naming**: It is common practice to use reverse domain names as package names to ensure uniqueness. For example, if your domain is `example.com`, you can create packages such as `com.example.utils` or `com.example.models`. This helps avoid naming conflicts and organizes code logically:
   ```java
   package com.example.utils; // A package for utility classes
   ```
