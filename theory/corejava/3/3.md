## Concurrency

- **Definition**: Enables multiple tasks to run in parallel or concurrently in Java.
- **Processes and Threads**: Processes are independent programs; threads are smaller tasks within a program.
- **Multithreading**: Multiple threads allow for concurrent execution within a program.
- **Concurrency Challenges**: Includes issues like thread interference and memory consistency errors.
- **Java Concurrency API**: Provides classes like `Thread`, `ExecutorService`, and `Future`.

## Processes and Threads

- **Process**: An independent executing instance of a program.
- **Thread**: A lightweight process within a program sharing the same resources.
- **Java Threads**: Managed using `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.
- **Concurrency**: Multiple threads can run concurrently, improving performance.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for tasks that require parallel processing, like file reading and GUI operations.

## Thread Objects

- **Thread Class**: Encapsulates a thread with methods to start, stop, and manage.
- **Creating Threads**: Extend `Thread` class or implement `Runnable` interface.
- **Methods**: `start()`, `run()`, and `join()` control thread behavior.
- **Thread States**: Threads have states like New, Runnable, Blocked, and Terminated.
- **Best Practice**: Use `Runnable` when possible for flexibility.

## Defining and Starting a Thread

- **Runnable Interface**: Define a `run` method with the task logic.
- **Thread Class**: Create a `Thread` object with `Runnable` and start it.
- **Method**: Call `start()` to execute the `run` method in a new thread.
- **Example**: `new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start();`.
- **Usage**: Preferred for short-lived, independent tasks.

## Pausing Execution with Sleep

- **Sleep Method**: Pauses thread execution for a specified time.
- **Syntax**: `Thread.sleep(milliseconds);`.
- **InterruptedException**: Must handle interruptions when sleep is interrupted.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for simulating delays or managing task intervals.
- **Best Practice**: Use sparingly as it can block thread execution.

## Interrupts

- **Purpose**: Allow threads to handle interrupt signals gracefully.
- **Interrupt Method**: `Thread.interrupt()` signals a thread to stop.
- **Checking Interruptions**: Use `isInterrupted()` or handle `InterruptedException`.
- **Common Usage**: Essential in multithreaded applications needing responsive stops.
- **Best Practice**: Implement clean exit strategies on interruption.

## Joins

- **Join Method**: Waits for a thread to finish before proceeding.
- **Usage**: `thread.join()` ensures thread completion before moving on.
- **Timeout Option**: Can specify a timeout for joining.
- **Blocking**: Join blocks the calling thread until the target thread ends.
- **Application**: Common in scenarios where thread dependencies exist.

## The SimpleThreads Example

- **Example Setup**: Demonstrates thread creation, start, join, and sleep.
- **Basic Structure**: A class implementing `Runnable` for task logic.
- **Execution Flow**: Shows how threads interact and manage resources.

- **Educational Use**: Basic demonstration of concurrency principles in Java.

## Synchronization

- **Purpose**: Prevents concurrent thread interference and ensures data consistency.
- **Synchronized Methods**: Lock access to methods or blocks of code.
- **Intrinsic Locks**: Each object has an intrinsic lock used for synchronization.
- **Use Case**: Critical for shared resources like counters or shared data structures.
- **Best Practice**: Synchronize only necessary sections for optimal performance.

## Thread Interference

- **Definition**: Conflicts that occur when multiple threads access shared data.
- **Data Race**: Threads alter shared data without coordination.
- **Example**: Incrementing a shared counter without synchronization.
- **Solution**: Use synchronization to prevent simultaneous access.
- **Application**: Common issue in counter, bank account, and shared resource scenarios.

## Memory Consistency Errors

- **Definition**: Inconsistent view of shared memory between threads.
- **Cause**: Happens when threads do not see updated values due to caching.
- **Volatile Keyword**: Use `volatile` to ensure visibility of changes.
- **Synchronization**: Guarantees memory consistency across threads.
- **Use Case**: Essential for variables accessed by multiple threads.

## Synchronized Methods

- **Definition**: Methods that lock access to prevent thread interference.
- **Syntax**: `public synchronized void method() { ... }`.
- **Object Lock**: Each object has a lock acquired by synchronized methods.
- **Example**: Ensures single-thread access to shared data.
- **Best Practice**: Minimize synchronized code for better performance.

## Intrinsic Locks and Synchronization

- **Intrinsic Lock**: Each object has a lock for synchronizing method access.
- **Synchronized Block**: Locks only specific code, improving efficiency.
- **Syntax**: `synchronized(this) { // code }`.
- **Avoid Deadlock**: Carefully manage locks to prevent thread blocking.
- **Use Case**: Ensures controlled access to critical code sections.

## Atomic Access

- **Purpose**: Ensures that operations on shared data are performed atomically.
- **Atomic Variables**: Use `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`, etc., for atomic operations.
- **Avoid Synchronization**: Atomic classes perform atomic operations without locks.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for counters, flags, and single-value shared variables.
- **Best Practice**: Prefer atomic classes for simple atomic needs.

## Liveness

- **Definition**: Refers to a program's ability to make progress.
- **Common Issues**: Deadlock, starvation, and livelock can prevent progress.
- **Deadlock**: Occurs when threads wait indefinitely on each other.
- **Starvation**: Thread unable to access resources for long periods.
- **Livelock**: Threads actively changing state but making no progress.

## Deadlock

- **Definition**: Occurs when two or more threads wait indefinitely for resources.
- **Cause**: Circular dependency on resources held by each other.
- **Avoidance**: Use ordering and try-locks to prevent deadlock.
- **Detection**: No built-in deadlock detection in Java; requires careful design.
- **Best Practice**: Avoid nested locks and release locks quickly.

## Starvation and Livelock

- **Starvation**: Thread does not get a chance to run due to resource allocation.
- **Livelock**: Threads keep changing states but do not proceed.
- **Cause**: Poor resource scheduling or thread handling.
- **Prevention**: Prioritize resource access and handle lock contention.
- **Use Case**: Relevant in high-concurrency environments with shared resources.

## Guarded Blocks

- **Definition**: Wait for a condition before proceeding.
- **Usage**: Common in scenarios with shared resources and timing constraints.
- **Methods**: Use `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` for thread communication.
- **Best Practice**: Use guarded blocks to avoid busy-waiting.
- **Application**: Common in producer-consumer patterns.

## Immutable Objects

- **Definition**: Objects whose state cannot be changed after creation.
- **Benefits**: Simplifies concurrency by avoiding thread interference.
- **Examples**: Use `final` keyword for fields, avoid setters.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for shared data across threads.
- **Best Practice**: Prefer immutable objects for shared, read-only data.

## A Synchronized Class Example

- **Example Setup**: Illustrates synchronization in a shared resource context.
- **Problem Statement**: Demonstrates concurrent access issues.
- **Solution**: Applies synchronized methods to prevent thread interference.
- **Best Practice**: Minimize synchronized blocks for optimal performance.
- **Educational Use**: Clear example for understanding synchronization.

## A Strategy for Defining Immutable Objects

- **Final Fields**: Use `final` keyword for all fields.
- **No Setters**: Do not provide methods to alter fields.
- **Private Constructors**: Restrict direct instantiation to control field values.
- **Builder Pattern**: Use a builder for complex object construction.
- **Benefits**: Guarantees thread safety without explicit synchronization.
